"""Primary state-action disagreement metric for the geometry-repair experiment.

The naive version of this metric -- draw random (state, action) pairs and see
whether truth and model agree on contact -- fails outright: the hard mode is a
thin region (a shape boundary) inside a much larger box, so an i.i.d. sample
almost never lands near it and the metric is dominated by uninformative
agreement on the "obviously nothing happens here" majority class. Every probe
here is instead placed by CONSTRUCTION, using `invert_integrator` (the exact
algebraic inverse of `integrate_2d`, already used the same way by
`instruments.py`'s mode probes) to solve for the state one step upstream of a
chosen target endpoint:

  - `band`   : boundary points displaced +-`band_d` along the true outward
               normal (`shape.normal_or_cone`, resolved to a single inward
               direction at cone vertices), alternating sign so the stratum is
               class-balanced by construction. This is the PRIMARY stratum --
               it is the one that actually stresses a model's boundary
               placement, since both truth and a geometrically-wrong model
               agree almost everywhere far from the boundary.
  - inside/outside: same boundary points, displaced along the normal by a
               depth that GROWS (bounded retries) until `env.contact` actually
               agrees with the intended label -- a safety net against
               curvature/degenerate-vertex cases where a fixed small offset
               might not flip the label.
  - `uniform`: genuine i.i.d. rejection sampling over (state, action), kept
               only if the resulting endpoint stays inside `box` (so the
               stratum still describes transitions relevant to the region of
               interest).
  - `planner`: real (state, action) pairs recorded off an MPC rollout, cycled
               to `n_per` -- what a truth-following controller actually visits,
               as opposed to any constructed probe.

Classification (label truth) for band/inside/outside uses `env.contact`,
which decides contact via `implicit_value(p) <= 0` (i.e., `shape.contains`),
never via `signed_distance`. The band is positioned by displacing a boundary
point by ±`band_d` along the unit normal from `shape.normal_or_cone` (a
Euclidean-length displacement, exact for Circle and approximate near high
curvature / polygon vertices, which are not yet tested here).
