"""Evidence-dose: a fixed 40-example transcript cap, env-aware, with
structured (source_index-keyed) failures so refinement can be shown to be
capped by the sample rather than by the model's competence.

Design (rev-3 plan, Task 12): the WHOLE transcript the LLM ever sees is
capped at 40 examples = m positives (contact fired) + m distinct matched
negatives (near-misses, matched to each kept positive by boundary-normal
distance) + (40 - 2m) background (neither positive nor a matched near-miss).
The background block is presented as controlled OBSERVATIONS, never as
FAILURES -- `refine_capped` only ever feeds back failures whose
`source_index` is in the 40 (`allowed_source_indices`); it also measures the
REAL gate on the full (e.g. 3200-transition) `gate_transitions` sample, so it
can tell the difference between "the model is still wrong" and "the model is
now as good as it can get given the 40 it was allowed to see" (an
`evidence_capped_failure`).
